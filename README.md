# benkpress-api

Small API to simplify the use of sklearn pipelines whose
training data have been built with the help of
[benkpress](https://github.com/dennishedback/benkpress),
without having to pull in all of benkpress as a dependency.
benkpress-api also uses a more permissive (BSD 2-clause) license
than benkpress proper does (GPLv3).
